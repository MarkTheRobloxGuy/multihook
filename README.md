# MultiHook
**MultiHook** is a Discord webhook tool primarily used for spamming webhooks easily. 

If this sounds like the right tool for you, go ahead and download the latest release!

## Contacts and Community
As of right now, we do not have any Discord/Telegram servers. If you find one for MultiHook, it is probably *or most certainly* a scam. Check back later if we ever make one! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Features
### Webhook Utilities
- Avatar Changer
- Username Changer
- Webhook Message Sender
- Webhook Message Spammer
- Webhook Deleter
### Settings

# Disclaimer
Discord is known to rate-limit IP's to stop webhook spamming. This also may lead to account suspension. I will not be responsible for your actions. Read about Discord [Terms Of service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)

MultiHook was created as a proof of concept that Discord webhooks can be automated.
